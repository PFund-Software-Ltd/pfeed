> **This library is NOT ready for use, please wait for 0.1.0 release.** 

## Problem
Starting algo-trading requires reliable and clean data, but traders often **work in silos**, each writing **duplicated code** to clean the same datasets—wasting time and effort. Accessing clean, ready-to-use data is a challenge, forcing traders to handle tedious data tasks before they can even start trading.

## Solution
`pfeed` leverages modern data engineering tools to centralize data cleaning efforts, automate ETL/ELT, store data in a **data lake with Delta Lake** support, and output **backtesting-ready data**, allowing traders to focus on strategy development.

---
PFeed (/piː fiːd/) is the data engine for trading, serving as a pipeline between raw data sources and traders. It enables you to **download historical data**, **stream real-time data**, and **store cleaned data** in a **local data lake for quantitative analysis**, supporting both **batch processing** and **streaming** workflows through streamlined data collection, cleaning, transformation, and storage.

## Core Features
- [x] Download or stream reliable, validated and **clean data** for research, backtesting, or live trading
- [x] Get historical data (**dataframe**) or live data in standardized formats by just calling a **single** function
- [x] **Own your data** by storing them locally using [MinIO] + [Deltalake], or in the cloud
- [x] Interact with different kinds of data (including TradFi, CeFi and DeFi) using a **unified interface**
- [x] Scale using modern data tools (e.g. [Polars], [Dask]) and workflow orchestration frameworks ([Prefect] for batch processing, [Bytewax] for streaming)

## Installation
> For more installation options, please refer to the [documentation](https://pfeed-docs.pfund.ai/installation).
```bash
# [RECOMMENDED]: Core Features, including Minio, Deltalake, Ray, etc.
pip install -U "pfeed[core,prefect,bytewax]"

# add your desired data sources, e.g. databento, polygon, etc.
pip install -U "pfeed[core,databento,polygon]"

# Minimal Features
pip install -U "pfeed"
```



## Quick Start
### 1. Get Historical Data in Dataframe
Get [Bybit]'s data in dataframe, e.g. 1-minute data (data is downloaded on the fly if not found in storage)

```python
import pfeed as pe

bybit = pe.Bybit(data_tool='polars')

df = bybit.get_historical_data(
    'BTC_USDT_PERP',
    resolution='1minute',  # 'raw' or '1tick'/'1t' or '2second'/'2s' etc.
    start_date='2025-01-01',
    end_date='2025-01-01',
)
```

Printing the first few rows of `df`:
| date                | resolution   | product       | symbol   |    open |    high |     low |   close |   volume |
|:--------------------|:-------------|:--------------|:---------|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|---------:|
| 2025-01-01 00:00:00 | 1m           | BTC_USDT_PERP | BTCUSDT  | 93530   | 93590.8 | 93501.3 | 93590.5 |   30.284 |
| 2025-01-01 00:01:00 | 1m           | BTC_USDT_PERP | BTCUSDT  | 93590.5 | 93627.7 | 93571.8 | 93625   |   30.334 |

> By using pfeed, you are just **one function call** away from getting a standardized dataframe

### 2. Download Historical Data on the Command Line Interface (CLI)
> For more CLI commands, please refer to the [documentation](https://pfeed-docs.pfund.ai/cli-commands).
```bash
# download BTC tick data
pfeed download -d BYBIT -p BTC_USDT_PERP -r tick --start-date 2025-01-01 --end-date 2025-02-01

# download data and store it in MinIO
pfeed download -d BYBIT -p BTC_USDT_PERP --storage minio
```

### 3. Download Historical Data in Python
```python
import pfeed as pe

bybit = pe.Bybit()
bybit.download(
    product='BTC_USDT_PERP',
    resolution='1s',  # 1-second data
    rollback_period='1w',  # rollback 1 week
    to_storage='local',
)
```
