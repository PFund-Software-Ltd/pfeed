# CONTRIBUTING 

`pfeed` is an ambitious project aiming to be the **go-to data engine** used by traders, researchers, and financial analysts to interact with **ALL** types of financial data.

Ideally, if `pfeed` attracts a large number of contributors, it will resolve the **problem of  duplicate libraries being created** to interact with the same data providers.

Conceptually, you can think of `pfeed` as a **meta-data provider** that unifies access to various financial data sources.

ðŸš§ A detailed contributing guide will be provided later.

In the meantime, you can contribute by:
- Reporting bugs
- Suggesting features
- Writing documentation
- Providing feedback
