  which includes every single trade and NBBO quote that occurs on any of the 19 US exchanges, 
  in the form of raw binary feeds, rather than through retransmission or intermediaries.
  For option data, we source directly from the Options Price Reporting Authority (OPRA).
  For forex data, we connect directly to a variety of institutional-level banks and liquidity providers.
  For indice data, we source from CME Group, CBOE, and Nasdaq. 
  For crypto data, we connect to some of the highest volume exchanges to consume the level 1 
  and level 2 order books. These currently include Coinbase, Kraken, BitFinex, and BitStamp.
